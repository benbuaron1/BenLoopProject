# Ben Buaron assignment - Audio Looper


Hello there,

The code for the audio looper is attached and hosted on GH-Pages.

The site lets you play the audio files and select which one to mute and use other functions.

I learned a lot working on this assignment, so thanks again.

I hope to hear from you soon,

Ben
